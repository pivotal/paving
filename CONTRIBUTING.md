# Contributing to the docs

The Paving project team welcomes contributions from the community. If you wish to contribute code 
and you have not signed our [contributor license agreement](https://cla.vmware.com/cla/1/preview), our bot will update the issue when 
you open a Pull Request. For any questions about the CLA process, please refer to our [FAQ](https://cla.vmware.com/faq).

## Start with a github issue

In all cases, following this workflow will help all contributors to docs to
participate more equitably:

1. Search existing github issues that may already describe the idea you have.
   If you find one, consider adding a comment that adds additional context 
   about your use case, 
   the exact problem you need solved and why, 
   and/or your interest in helping to contribute to that effort.
2. If there is no existing issue that covers your idea, 
   open a new issue to describe the change you would like to see in docs. 
   Please provide as much context as you can about your use case, 
   the exact problem you need solved and why,
   and the reason why you would like to see this change. 
   If you are reporting a bug, please include steps 
   to reproduce the issue if possible.
3. Any number of folks from the community
   may comment on your issue and ask additional questions.
   A maintainer will add the `pr welcome` label to the issue
   when it has been determined that the change will be welcome.
   Anyone from the community may step in to make that change.
4. If you intend to make the changes, comment on the issue
   to indicate your interest in working on it to reduce the likelihood that
   more than one person starts to work on it independently.

## Contributing your changes

1. When you have a set of changes to contribute back to docs, 
   create a pull request (PR) 
   and reference the issue that the changes in the PR are addressing. 
   Ensure the PR is made against the correct version of the docs,
   which are branched by the release version on Tanzu Network,
   or contribute new docs directly to `develop`.
1. Your pull request will be reviewed by one or more maintainers.
   You may also receive feedback from others in the community.
   The feedback may come in the form of requests for additional changes
   to meet expectations for code quality or consistency.
   Or it could be clarifying questions
   to better understand the decisions you made in your implementation.
1. When a maintainer accepts your changes,
   they will merge your pull request.
   If there are outstanding requests for changes
   or other small changes they feel can be made to improve the changed code,
   they may make additional changes or merge the changes manually.
   It's always nice to have changes come in just as the team would like to see them,
   but we'll try not to hold up a pull request for a long period of time
   due to minor changes.
